                    Nick spends his life exploring and immersing himself in detail.  His
                    artworks are a reflection of his ability to extract emotion from a
                    setting and then to amplify it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nick's artistic journey began at Michaelhouse high school in the
                    midlands of KwaZulu Natal South Africa.  Here he painted a series of
                    finely detailed oil paintings exploring several themes.  "Unexpected
                    Beauty" portrayed the mushroom clouds of atomic explosions, and "Time
                    and Trace" was the inspiration for his sepia-tone self-portrait
                    depicted on his website.

                    His work achieved the highest honours, and he was selected to exhibit
                    in the Tatham art gallery in Pietermaritzburg, with a piece placed on
                    permanent exhibit in the provincial buildings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nick attended the University of the Witwatersrand where he explored
                    alternative means of expression.  Without prior training, he taught
                    himself auditioned, and was offered admission to be tutored under one
                    of South Africa's preeminent pianists --Marian Friedman.  He was
                    awarded first prize at the MTN music festival for his performance
                    Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G# Minor.  Other awards and scholarships
                    followed in subsequent years.  Nick also explored computer animation
                    and composed several items as part of his digital portfolio.  He
                    achieved distinctions for his work.

                <p>
                    During the last five years, Nick returned to painting.  He employs his
                    strong foundation and sensitivity to depictions of nature.  His recent
                    works include impressionist oil landscapes and forest scenes, and
                    finely detailed watercolour paintings of birds and flowers.  In a
                    recent series, Nick selected poses which convey the weaver bird's
                    unique personality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nick was offered positions to study fine art at the University of
                    Edinburgh and the University of Arts in London.  Unfortunately, he
                    turned down both offers for financial reasons.  Both are possibilities
                    in due course.  Nick plans to continue painting in watercolour and
                    oils and expand on his depictions of nature, where he finds calm and
                    inspiration.
